PetShield – Android App (Final POE)

#Project Overview

PetShield is an Android mobile application designed to help pet owners manage their pets’ health and safety.
The app allows users to register pets, track vaccinations, report lost pets, and connect with nearby shelters and veterinarians.

It integrates:

Firebase Authentication (for secure login and registration),

Firebase Firestore Database (to store pet and user data),

Cloud Storage / API services (for pet images and reports).

The app was developed with a focus on user experience, data security, and stability, handling all invalid inputs gracefully without crashing.
