The name for the app is Petshield.Petshield is a mobile and web application that allows pet owners to securely store and track their pets’ medical records, vaccinations, appointments, and emergency contacts. It also connects users with veterinarians, pet care services, and provides reminders for health check-ups, medication, and vaccinations — ensuring every pet stays protected and cared for.

The innovative features that we have added are.
➢ The app will have notification settings provided for all users, including alerts 
for upcoming vet appointments
➢ The app will be able to provide health and activity reports to the user in the 
form of Pie charts, Line graphs, and Statistics with percentages, dates, 
symptoms tracked, vet visits, and progress over time. This helps users 
visualize their pet’s wellbeing and identify patterns.
➢ The application dashboard will consistently inform the user about their pet’s 
health status, missed alerts, and upcoming tasks. It will also highlight positive 
habits such as regular check-ins or completed vaccinations, encouraging 
responsible pet care.
➢ The app will be able to calculate and display metrics such as age in months, 
weight trends, feeding portions, and estimated costs for treatments or 
subscriptions. These calculations help users manage pet care more efficiently 
and budget accordingly.
