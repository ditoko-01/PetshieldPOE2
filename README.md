# PetshieldPOE2
Overview of the App 
PetShield is an all-inclusive, mobile-first app made to assist pet owners in controlling 
the identification, safety, and health of their animals. It combines emergency 
warnings, health support, community involvement, and veterinary consultations into 
a single user-friendly platform, and it supports all pet kinds, including dogs, cats, 
birds, reptiles, and more.
Icon design
The name for the app is Petshield. It is a personal budget app that helps users 
manage their finances and develop good spending habits. This prototype has 
been built after the study of three other personal budget applications namely; 
Virbac backHome App, Tame A Vet App & PetPins App.
The innovative features that we have added are.
➢ The app will have notification settings provided for all users, including alerts 
for upcoming vet appointments, vaccination reminders, subscription renewals, 
and emergency updates. Users can also customize reminders for feeding 
schedules, grooming, and medication.
➢ The application will allow users to export and print pet profiles, medical 
records, vaccination certificates, and emergency reports. These documents 
can be used for travel, adoption, or veterinary purposes when needed.
➢ The app will be able to provide health and activity reports to the user in the 
form of Pie charts, Line graphs, and Statistics with percentages, dates, 
symptoms tracked, vet visits, and progress over time. This helps users 
visualize their pet’s wellbeing and identify patterns.
➢ The application dashboard will consistently inform the user about their pet’s 


health status, missed alerts, and upcoming tasks. It will also highlight positive 
habits such as regular check-ins or completed vaccinations, encouraging 
responsible pet care.
➢ The app will be able to calculate and display metrics such as age in months, 
weight trends, feeding portions, and estimated costs for treatments or 
subscriptions. These calculations help users manage pet care more efficiently 
and budget accordingly.
